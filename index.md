# What you should know about the property

## Our Staff
First off, the staff here are all rockstarts. They will be doing a number of things every day to ensure you are happy and that grounds are well kept.

You room will be refreshed at least every three days. If you would like a more frequent cleaning they will happily accomodate.

If you see them approaching you with a clipboard, they aren't taking attendance. No, they just need your breakfast order before 7pm, so they have the information they need to when they go to gather your groceries early in the morning.

Living in Bali means we have mossies to deal with. Put it on your calendar the Fumigation goes down every Tuesday from 2pm to 3pm. Unless you want to hangout in a cloud of cemicals you'll want to make plans to be else where during this time.
