A lot of people come to Canggu for a slightly more chill vibe than Seminyak or Kuta. Here we have the surf, rice fields, healthly cafes and more coworking spaces than your inner hustler knows what to do with.

## What does it looking like to play in Canggu?

### Surfing at Oldmans
Canggu is a great place to explore your inner surfer. Get to the beach early in the morning before the fun is high in the sky. Boards from the beach rentals will run you about 50k.

If you are taking your bike you will need to pay the parking lot attendant 2k for a ticket to let you park. Don't haggle. Just pay the 2k.

After a good session in the wave you can find a fresh coconut to sip on for around 20k.

### Yoga
The most well know studios in Canggu are [Samadi]()https://www.samadibali.com/) and [The Practice](https://www.thepracticebali.com/yoga/schedule/). I have only visited Samadi for their Sunday farmers market, so I can't speak for their classes, but their space looks amazing. I have friends who enjoy The Practice, but, again, I can speak directly for it.

Give them both a go and let me know what you think. That way we can share your experience with others looking to enjoy a deep breathe with a side of streche.

### Sunsets
Okay, we are seriously spoiled with the sunset situation here. The place I know to enjoy this daily blessing is the deck of [La Brisa](http://labrisabali.com/). Get there before 5 to have the best chance of a front row bean bag chair or wicker rocker.

Not only is the sunset here amazing, but they are one of the most sustainable clubs in all of Canggu. Read their full story [here](http://labrisabali.com/our-story/)
