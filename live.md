## SIM Card
Any of the the street vendor selling electronics up and down Batu Bolong should be able to hook you up with a 10 GB SIM for $100k (~$7 USD). Yes, data is that cheap :P

If you would like a local number, then you will need to provide identification and your phone must be unlocked. Otherwise, you will be running off of cafe WiFi and a roaming plan from your current provider.

## Laundry
Dirty clothes happen. We have you cover. Simply drop your clothes off with staff and they will take care of the rest. The earlier you drop them off in the day the more likely you are to receive your items within 24 hours. Upon retreiving your items, you can pay on the spot or sign you your name on the receipe and Outsite will follow up at the end of your stay.
