Life in Bali has a sort of rythme you won't find in many other places around the planet. Sun rises and sets nearly the same time everyday of the year. Expect to see to sun rise into the sky around 6:30 am and set over the horizon around 6:30pm. This rythme can make for a productive way of being.

Our lives here are Outsite have a regular cadance as well.

# The Weekly Ritual
- Tuesday // Mosiquite fumigation from 2pm to 3pm
- Wednesday // Game night from 6pm to 9pm
- Saturday  // Beach clean up with Trash Hero Canggu from 4:30pm to 5:30pm
- Sunday // Samadi farmers marker from 9am to 12pm

The time in between is open for interpretation, but at least you have a strong base to build off.

# Communication
Unless you are taking the route of roaming charges, you are going to want a SIM card.

Any of the the street vendors you see selling electronics up and down Batu Bolong will be able to hook you up with a 10 GB SIM for $100k (~$7 USD). Personally, I frequently the kind Women under the Samsung sign on the left side of Raya Canggu after you make a right off Batu Bolong.

If you would like a local number, be sure to rock up to the window with a form of identification and your phone unlocked.

# Transportation
Haven't noticed how hectic is can be getting around Bali? It honestly is that bad. You just need to get a bike.

Ideally, we would have a bike ready for you before you arrive, but maybe you were on the fence about riding and it took a couple sunburns to convince to take the leap.

Either way, our front desk will gladly get you a pair of wheels so your adventures can begin.

If motorbiking isn't in your future, you will want to make a friend at Outsite who rides or get comfortable with [Go Jek](https://www.go-jek.com/), this Google backed company is the Uber of Indonesian.

# Hygiene
While this isn't a hotel, we have some services on site are sure to make you feel pampered.

## Your Room
You room will be refreshed at least every three days. If you would like a more frequent cleanings then just let the staff no.

Cleaning your room will include new sheets and a bed made tighter than you'll ever manage. If you are lucky, the team will folder you towel into a fancy form. They may also top up your soap and arrange your items on the sink counter more nicely then you.

I think they have OCD, but it's okay by me.

## Laundry
Dirty clothes happen, especially here in Bali. Your gym clothes might have lasted a few sessions in more temperate climates, but not here.

Don't sweat it, we have you covered. Simply drop your clothes off with our staff at the front desk and they will take care of the rest.

The earlier you leave your clothed with them the more likely you are to get your items back with 24 hours.

Now, you can pay for your personal items on the spot or on your way out. We'll keep track of the damage with your signature either way.

# Living Peace with the Envionrment
We have partners in Bali that make the world a better place one piece of trash at a time. We hope you will take up the tourch to look after the islands as well.
